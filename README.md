# Text_Extraction_NLP_2023
My project is a solution to the problem of extracting the desired fragment from the text that matches the query. Corpus in Russian. The purpose of the study is to understand which approach to solving this problem is better than QA or NER.
Introduction
Often, when working with documents, you have to extract: arbitration claims, public procurement, enforcement proceedings. This is required in order to complete the application form. But a person does not cope with this task quickly: he needs to read the text, analyze it, highlight the desired fragment of the text. These activities take time. Therefore, I developed a model that will help the public procurement department extract the right piece of text from the document in order to form the application form.
